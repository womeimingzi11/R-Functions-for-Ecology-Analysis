# R-Functions-for-Ecology-Analysis

Some analysis functions for Ecology with the language of R. Some are wroten by myself, some are collected frome Stack Overflow

In the directory **Data Analysis**, there are Batch Shapiro Test for nomality test for row data. As for Box-Cox tranformation, it will help you to find the best Lambda Value automaticly.

*PS.* Maybe I wiil add the switch to choose which method to calculate the lambda, guerrero or loglike.

In the directory **Data Analysis/Anova**, it will plot the Tukey-Range Test Figure, if you need some Post-Host test.

In the directory **DataIO**, you will know what's that from the filename, frankly speaking, I get the function from Stack Overflow, if you know who wrote this functions, please connect with me.
